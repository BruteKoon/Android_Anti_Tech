# Android Client Detection

## Client_Protect (do not use Server_Protect)
Client Protect includes anti-debugging techniques and check techniques for anti-reversing on Android.
The Server Protect folder exists, but we have not implemented any of these technologies.





# Client_Prac / Server_Prac
This is a simple example. 
Client Prac is the code that implemented a simple snake game. Server_prac is a server example for login authentication in Client_Prac, which has nothing to do with using only Cleint_Prac.
